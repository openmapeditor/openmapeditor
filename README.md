# OpenMapEditor

</div>

OpenMapEditor is a simple, powerful web-based editor for creating, viewing, and managing geographic data like paths, areas, and markers. Built with Leaflet.js, it supports interactive drawing, file import/export (GeoJSON, GPX, KML, KMZ), routing, elevation profiles, custom styling, and Strava activity integration.

---

## Features

- **Privacy First:** Your files are processed entirely on your local machine and are never uploaded to a server. Optional features like routing and elevation profiles send only the necessary coordinates to external APIs to function.
- **Draw & Edit:** Easily draw new paths, areas, and markers directly on the map, or edit existing items.
- **File Support:** Import GeoJSON, GPX, KML, and KMZ files. Export to GeoJSON, GPX, and KML formats.
- **Full Color Support:** Supports all 140 CSS color names and custom hex values. Colors are preserved across imports and exports.
- **Organic Maps Compatible:** Import GeoJSON exports from Organic Maps.
- **Google Earth & My Maps Compatible:** KML exports work seamlessly with Google Earth Web, Google Earth Desktop, and Google My Maps.
- **Shareable Links:** Generate shareable URLs containing your map view and all features, making it easy to share your maps with others.
- **Routing:** Generate routes for driving, biking, or walking. You can then save the generated route as an editable path.
- **Elevation Profiles:** Instantly visualize the elevation profile for any path.
- **Strava Integration:** Connect your Strava account to view your activities on the map, download their original high-resolution GPX tracks, or duplicate them for editing.
- **Custom WMS Layers:** Import map layers from any WMS-compatible service. Browse available layers, add them to your map as overlays, and reorder them with drag-and-drop. Your WMS layers are saved locally and persist between sessions.
- **POI Finder:** Search for points of interest (parks, restaurants, viewpoints, etc.) in the current map view using OpenStreetMap data, and save them directly to your map.
- **Performance Optimized:** Optional path and area simplification (on by default) for smoother performance. When enabled, simplified copies are made when duplicating tracks/activities/areas (originals preserved), and generated routes are simplified when saved. Configurable in settings.

## Privacy

OpenMapEditor is designed with privacy as a priority. All processing of your imported geographic data files (GeoJSON, GPX, KML, KMZ) happens **entirely in your web browser**. Your files are never uploaded to or stored on any server.

The application only sends data to external services for specific, optional features that require an API. This communication is limited to the minimum data necessary for the feature to function:

- **Initial Map Centering:** Your approximate location is determined using the Google Geolocation API to center the map on your region on first load.
- **Routing:** When you request a route, the coordinates of your start, end, and via points are sent to the selected routing provider.
- **Elevation Profiles:** When elevation data is already present in your file, it is used directly. Otherwise, path coordinates are sent to your chosen elevation provider (Google Maps Elevation API or GeoAdmin API for paths in Switzerland).
- **Search:** Text queries are sent to OpenStreetMap's Nominatim geocoding service to find and display locations on the map.
- **POI Finder:** Search queries and map bounds are sent to OpenStreetMap's Overpass API to find points of interest in the current map view.
- **Strava Integration:** Communicates directly with the Strava API after user authorization.

## Local Development Setup

This project is self-contained and does not require a package manager (`npm`).

1.  **Clone the Repository**

    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/openmapeditor/openmapeditor](https://github.com/openmapeditor/openmapeditor)
    ```

2.  **Provide API Keys**
    See the **"Configuring API Keys"** section below for detailed instructions.

3.  **Run the Application**
    Local development requires running the project from a local web server. Opening `index.html` directly from your filesystem will not work correctly.

4.  **Code Formatting**
    The project uses the Prettier CLI (rather than the VS Code extension) to ensure consistent formatting across all environments. It is configured with a 100-character line width in [.prettierrc](.prettierrc).
    - **Via CLI**: Format a specific file with `npx prettier --write "path/to/file"`.
    - **Via VS Code**: Run the "Format with Prettier CLI" task (Terminal > Run Task...).
    - **Pro Tip**: Check the comments in [.vscode/tasks.json](.vscode/tasks.json) for instructions on how to bind this task to the standard Shift+Alt+F shortcut.

## Production Deployment

Deployment to GitHub Pages is handled automatically by the GitHub Action located in `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`. The action runs automatically on every push to the `main` branch.

**In addition to deploying the site, the workflow also performs critical performance optimizations. It bundles all JavaScript files located between the `<!-- START-BUNDLE -->` and `<!-- END-BUNDLE -->` comments in `index.html` into a single script, minifies it to reduce its size, and updates `index.html` to load the final optimized file (`app.min.js`).**

For the deployment to succeed, you must provide your production API keys as repository secrets. See the **"Configuring API Keys"** section below for details.

---

## Configuring API Keys

To enable features that rely on external services, you must provide your own API keys.

### A. For Local Development

1.  Make a copy of the template file `js/secrets.js.example`.
2.  Rename the copy to **`js/secrets.js`**.
3.  Open the new `js/secrets.js` and fill in your actual API keys using the following `camelCase` variable names:
    - `googleApiKey`
    - `mapboxAccessToken`
    - `tracestrackApiKey`
    - `stravaClientId` (Optional)
    - `stravaClientSecret` (Optional)

> The `secrets.js` file is listed in `.gitignore` and will not be committed to the repository, keeping your keys safe.

### B. For Production Deployment

For the deployment to succeed, you must provide your production API keys as GitHub repository secrets.

1.  In your GitHub repository, go to **Settings > Secrets and variables > Actions**.
2.  Click **New repository secret** for each key listed below, ensuring the names match the `SNAKE_CASE` format exactly:
    - `GOOGLE_API_KEY`
    - `MAPBOX_ACCESS_TOKEN`
    - `TRACESTRACK_API_KEY`
    - `STRAVA_CLIENT_ID` (Optional)
    - `STRAVA_CLIENT_SECRET` (Optional)

### Important API Notes

> **Google API Note:** Your `GOOGLE_API_KEY` must have the following APIs enabled in your Google Cloud Platform project:
>
> - **Geolocation API** (for automatic map centering based on user location)
> - **Maps Elevation API** (for elevation profiles)
> - **Maps JavaScript API** (required dependency for the Maps Elevation API)

> **GeoAdmin API Note:** The GeoAdmin API is free and does not require an API key. It only works for paths within Switzerland.

> **Strava API Note:** If you leave the `STRAVA_CLIENT_ID` and `STRAVA_CLIENT_SECRET` fields empty or do not provide them as secrets, the application will instead prompt end-users to provide their own personal API keys to use the integration.

## Customizing & Forking

This project is designed to be easily forked and customized. All primary branding can be configured in one place.

1.  **Edit the Configuration File**
    Open `js/config.js` and change the values of the `APP_NAME`, `APP_TITLE`, `APP_DESCRIPTION`, `APP_CREDITS_DESCRIPTION` and `APP_DOMAIN` variables to match your project.

    > The placeholders in `index.html` and `manifest.json` are replaced automatically by the GitHub deployment action. **You do not need to edit these files manually.**

2.  **Update Other Files**
    For a complete re-branding, you should also manually update the following:
    - **`README.md`**: Update the documentation with your project's information.
    - **`privacy.html`**: This is a legal document. You **must** review it and update it with your own contact information and policies.
    - **Contact & Repo URLs**: Change the email and GitHub links in `credits.html` and `privacy.html`.
    - **Copyright & Author**: Update your name and the year in the copyright headers of the source files and in `AUTHORS.md`.
