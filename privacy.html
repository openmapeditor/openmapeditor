      <h1>Privacy Policy for OpenMapEditor</h1>
      <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> January 27, 2026</p>

      <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        Welcome to OpenMapEditor. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle your information when
        you use our web application. Your privacy is critically important to us.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Core Privacy Principle:</strong> OpenMapEditor operates entirely within your web
        browser (client-side). Your geographic data files (GeoJSON, GPX, KML, KMZ) are processed on
        your local machine and are never uploaded to, or stored on, our servers.
      </p>

      <h2>2. Automatic Location Detection</h2>
      <p>
        When you first load the map without a saved location in the URL, your approximate location
        is automatically determined using the Google Geolocation API to center the map on your
        region. This provides a better initial experience by showing a relevant area instead of a
        world view. This does not track or store your location and happens only once on page load.
      </p>

      <h2>3. Third-Party Services for Optional Features</h2>
      <p>
        To provide optional features like routing, elevation profiles, search, and POI finder, we
        send the minimum necessary data to specialized third-party services. Your personal files are
        never sent.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Routing:</strong> When you calculate a route, the coordinates of your start, end,
          and via points are sent to your chosen provider (Mapbox or OSRM).
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Elevation Profiles:</strong> When elevation data is already present in your file,
          it is used directly. Otherwise, the path's coordinates are sent to your chosen elevation
          provider (Google Maps Elevation API or GeoAdmin API for paths in Switzerland).
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Search:</strong> When you use the search bar, your text query is sent to
          OpenStreetMap to find locations.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>POI Finder:</strong> Search queries and map bounds are sent to OpenStreetMap's
          Overpass API to find points of interest in the current map view.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        We encourage you to review the privacy policies of these third-party services for more
        information on how they handle data.
      </p>

      <h2>4. Strava Integration</h2>
      <p>
        To use the Strava integration, you provide your own personal Strava API credentials (Client
        ID and Client Secret) from an API application you create in your own Strava account. These
        keys are kept in memory only and are never saved or transmitted to our servers.
      </p>
      <p>Your activity data is processed only in your browser and is never stored on any server.</p>

      <h2>5. Information Accessed via the Strava API</h2>
      <p>
        When you authorize access to your Strava account, the application running in your browser
        may fetch the following types of data directly from the Strava API:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Strava Profile Information:</strong> Your basic profile details to confirm your
          identity.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Activity Data:</strong> Your activity history, including details like name, type,
          distance, time, and summary polylines (routes).
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        This data is fetched directly from Strava to your browser and processed entirely
        client-side. OpenMapEditor's servers never receive or have access to this data. An
        authentication token is stored temporarily in your browser's <code>sessionStorage</code>
        and is deleted when you close the browser tab.
      </p>

      <h2>6. How Your Information Is Used</h2>
      <p>
        All data fetched from third-party services (including Strava) is used solely to provide the
        application's functionality and is processed entirely in your browser.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Important:</strong> Because OpenMapEditor operates client-side, we never receive,
        store, or have access to your Strava data. Your activity information stays entirely within
        your browser session.
      </p>

      <h2>7. Strava API Terms</h2>
      <p>
        When you create your own Strava API application and use it with OpenMapEditor, you are
        subject to Strava's API Agreement and their privacy policy. Strava may monitor and collect
        usage data related to API calls made through your application. Please review Strava's terms
        for more information.
      </p>

      <h2>8. Your Rights and Data Control</h2>
      <p>You have full control over your data.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Session Data:</strong> All Strava data is automatically cleared from the
          application when you close your browser tab.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>API Credentials:</strong> Your API keys are kept only in memory and are never
          saved. Simply closing the browser tab or refreshing the page clears them.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Your Strava App:</strong> You can delete or modify your personal Strava API
          application at any time in your Strava account settings.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>9. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
      <p>
        We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by
        posting the new Privacy Policy on this page.
      </p>
